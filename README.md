## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a biomedical engineer with a strong passion for medical image analysis, artificial intelligence and automated diagnosis. I'm especially interested in translating fundamental findings from the field of computer vision into a clinically relevant algorithm by integrating technical and clinical domain-specific knowledge. I'm a critical person who loves to work in an interdisciplinary environment and don't not fear a strong deadline.
